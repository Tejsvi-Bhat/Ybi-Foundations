# Big Sales Prediction

This project utilizes a Random Forest Regressor to predict sales based on historical data. 

## Project Overview

The notebook available in this repository provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the following steps:

- Data Import and Exploration
- Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Model Training (Random Forest Regressor)
- Model Evaluation and Visualization

## How to Use

1. Access the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uIM7_kLR5fgRsUod2XFplICEMzkR5H6d?usp=sharing).
2. Run the code cells sequentially to follow the analysis.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Results

The model achieves a `0.5806344037136959` R-squared score on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting sales.
